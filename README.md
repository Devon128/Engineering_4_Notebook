### Assignment Description

Write your assignment description here. What is the purpose of this assignment? It should be at least a few sentences.

### Evidence 

[New CircuitPython on Raspberry Pi Pico Project - Wokwi Simulator - Google Chrome 2022-09-09 13-53-28.zip](https://github.com/Devon128/Engineering_4_Notebook/files/9550439/New.CircuitPython.on.Raspberry.Pi.Pico.Project.-.Wokwi.Simulator.-.Google.Chrome.2022-09-09.13-53-28.zip)
### Wiring

This may not be applicable to all assignments. Anything where you wire something up, include the wiring diagram here. The diagram should be clear enough that I can recreate the wiring from scratch.

### Reflection

What went wrong / was challenging, how'd you figure it out, and what did you learn from that experience? Your goal for the reflection is to pass on knowledge that will make this assignment better or easier for the next person. Think about your audience for this one, which may be "future you" (when you realize you need some of this code in three months), me, or your college admission committee!
