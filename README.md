## Launch Pad 1

### Assignment Description

This assignment was the initial step to it all. I had to make a countdown from 10 seconds to liftoff (0 seconds). This countdown also had to be printed on an serial monitor.

### Wiring

This may not be applicable to all assignments. Anything where you wire something up, include the wiring diagram here. The diagram should be clear enough that I can recreate the wiring from scratch.

### Reflection

It wasn't really a challenge in my opinion. I did make some mistakes on this though , and i will say that one thing i needed help on was the for loop code, i didn't really understand it. But despite that i got it done!!

## Launch Pad 2

### Assignment Description

This assignment was basiclly an add on to part 1, i had to get an red Led blinking every second of the countdown and make an green led turn on to signifiy liftoff.

### Reflection

This was a not so bad assignment. Now i did have an problem with one of the leds , don't remmember which one it was but it was burnt out so i used the LED on the board instead.

## Launch Pad 3

### Assignment Description

This was an add on to both Launch pad 1 and 2. I had to include an physical button that started off the countdown and still have my leds and serial monitor working.

### Wiring


### Code

### Reflection

It was a little harder than the other 2 because i never used a button so i had to learn how to wire it up and i also had to find the code for it.


## Launch Pad 4

### Assignment Description

This was also an add on to the other launch pad assignments. The only thing different from this one is that i had to actuate a 180 degree servo on lifftoff to simulate the launch tower disconnecting.

### Reflection
This wasn't really that hard. I took some old code from an old assignment that used some servo code to help me with some part of it.
But other than some part of the code , there were really no other problems i had with this assignment.


## Crash Avoidance 1

### Assignment Description
in this assignment i had to wire up an accelerometer that returns acceleration values for the x, y, and z axes to the serial monitor.

### Reflection

This was a tough assignment for me but i had some help by my former classmate Jason.I learned some new things while doing this assignment


## Crash Avoidance 2

### Assignment Description
This was an add on to the 1st Avoidance task. I had to use the acceleration values to trigger a warning light if the helicopter is tilted 90 degrees.

### Reflection

This took me one class to do. My classmate jason also helped me somewhat on this assignment . I also learned how to use the acceleration values to trigger a warning light.

## Crash Avoidance 3

### Assignment Description
Another add on to the Avoidance collection. In this assignment the task was to simply add an OLED screen to print live angular velocity values.

### Code
https://github.com/Devon128/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/Crash%20Advoidance3.py

### Reflection
This was a pretty solid / simple task because i used some old code from a pass assignment when i used a screen to print hello and a name of some sort.
Note to my future self is that i can always go back to these assignments and use some code if i'm stuck.

## Landing Area 1

### Assignment Description

I had to write an script that takes three coordinates and returns the area using a function.

### Wiring
I don't think there was any real wiring for this assignment 
### Code
https://github.com/Devon128/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/Landing%20area.py
### Reflection
This was very time consuming but i got it done. It was the toughest assignment i had to do so far. There were a lot of mistakes i made but fixed. Like before i need to work on getting my code in the right spot and tabbing it.
