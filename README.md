## Launch Pad 1

### Assignment Description

This assignment was the initial step to it all. I had to make a countdown from 10 seconds to liftoff (0 seconds). This countdown also had to be printed on an serial monitor.

### Wiring

This may not be applicable to all assignments. Anything where you wire something up, include the wiring diagram here. The diagram should be clear enough that I can recreate the wiring from scratch.

### Reflection

It wasn't really a challenge in my opinion. I did make some mistakes on this though , and i will say that one thing i needed help on was the for loop code, i didn't really understand it. But despite that i got it done!!

## Launch Pad 2

### Assignment Description

This assignment was basiclly an add on to part 1, i had to get an red Led blinking every second of the countdown and make an green led turn on to signifiy liftoff.

### Reflection

This was a not so bad assignment. Now i did have an problem with one of the leds , don't remmember which one it was but it was burnt out so i used the LED on the board instead.

## Launch Pad 3

### Assignment Description

This was an add on to both Launch pad 1 and 2. I had to include an physical button that started off the countdown and still have my leds and serial monitor working.

### Evidence

### Wiring


### Code

https://github.com/Devon128/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/Launch3.py


### Reflection

It was a little harder than the other 2 because i never used a button so i had to learn how to wire it up and i also had to find the code for it.


## Launch Pad 4

### Assignment Description

This was also an add on to the other launch pad assignments. The only thing different from this one is that i had to actuate a 180 degree servo on lifftoff to simulate the launch tower disconnecting.

### Wiring

### Code

### Reflection
This wasn't really that hard. I took some old code from an old assignment that used some servo code to help me with some part of it.
But other than some part of the code , there were really no other problems i had with this assignment.


## Crash Avoidance 1

### Assignment Description
in this assignment i had to wire up an accelerometer that returns acceleration values for the x, y, and z axes to the serial monitor.


### Evidence

### Code

### Reflection

This was a tough assignment for me but i had some help by my former classmate Jason.I learned some new things while doing this assignment


## Crash Avoidance 2

### Assignment Description
This was an add on to the 1st Avoidance task. I had to use the acceleration values to trigger a warning light if the helicopter is tilted 90 degrees.

### Evidence

### Reflection

This took me one class to do. My classmate jason also helped me somewhat on this assignment . I also learned how to use the acceleration values to trigger a warning light.

## Crash Avoidance 3

### Assignment Description
Another add on to the Avoidance collection. In this assignment the task was to simply add an OLED screen to print live angular velocity values.

### Wiring

### Code
https://github.com/Devon128/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/Crash%20Advoidance3.py

### Reflection
This was a pretty solid / simple task because i used some old code from a pass assignment when i used a screen to print hello and a name of some sort.
Note to my future self is that i can always go back to these assignments and use some code if i'm stuck.

## Landing Area 1

### Assignment Description

I had to write an script that takes three coordinates and returns the area using a function.

### Evidence

### Wiring
I don't think there was any real wiring for this assignment 
### Code

### Reflection
This was very time consuming but i got it done. It was the toughest assignment i had to do so far. There were a lot of mistakes i made but fixed. Like before i need to work on getting my code in the right spot and tabbing it.

















## FEA 1

### Assignment Description.
Had to design a 3D printed in Onshape with the goal of maximizing the weight the beam can hold before failure.
### Evidence

### Wiring
no wiring for this assignment 

### Reflection
Its complete , didn't take me and my paretner long to come up with a design. We tweaked it a little though.


## FEA 2

### Assignment Description.
Me and Cole had to run one static finite element analysis on our beam to determine what areas need to be improved.
### Evidence

### Wiring
no wiring 

### Reflection
There was some stress in our designa couple of times so we tried to change itup a little and used all four of our simulations.One thing i learned from this assignment is that i should always takeaway from the blue and give it to the red.



## FEA 3

### Assignment Description.
Me and Cole had to use data from FEA simulations to improve the maximum weight the beam can hold before meeting one of the two failure conditions.

It was an pretty cool assignment.

## 4.1 - Ring and Spinner

### Assignment Description.
Work with a partner to create either the Ring or Spinner

 I made the ring. It was pretty smooth and i re-learned some shortcut keys.
 

## 4.2 Key and Prop

### Assignment Description.
Me and my partner had to make the key and prop.
### Evidence

### Wiring

no wiring
### Reflection
I made the key. It was pretty smooth. Although i did make a mistake and had to go back some steps due to the fact that i forgot about how i could  use the  = constraint feature  that would've  made the angles of my sketch the same length.

## 4.3 Assembly 

### Assignment Description.
 Assemble all of the parts that we made.

It was pretty tough but good becuase it help me re-learn how to mate and told me what mates did what.
